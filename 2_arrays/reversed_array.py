"""The Fibonacci numbers form a sequence of integers defined recursively in the
following way. The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The first few elements in this sequence are: 0,
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13. Letâ€™s write a program that prints all the Fibonacci numbers, not exceeding
a given integer n."""
